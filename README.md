# DSA-Practice

I have been consistently solving DSA problems for over a year now, following **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**.  
This repository will contain all the problems I have solved from the sheet, with each problem placed in its own folder.  

Each problem folder includes:
- A **README.md** file containing the problem statement and a brief explanation.
- A **C++ solution file** showing my approach to solving the problem.

I have almost completed the sheet and am now uploading all my solutions here for **future reference** and **revision purposes**.  
If you happen to come across this repository, I hope you find these solutions helpful as a reference for your own learning.
