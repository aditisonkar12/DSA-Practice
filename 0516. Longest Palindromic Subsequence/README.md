## [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest palindromic **subsequence** in `s`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

---

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
s = "bbbab"  
**Output:**  
4  
**Explanation:**  
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is `"bbbb"`, with length `4`.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
s = "cbbd"  
**Output:**  
2  
**Explanation:**  
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is `"bb"`, with length `2`.

---

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
